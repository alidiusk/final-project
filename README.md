## Datasets
We used [Covid-19 data from Allegheny County](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-covid-19-tests-cases-and-deaths/resource/0f214885-ff3e-44e1-9963-e9e9062a04d1) that describes the Covid-19 cases, deaths, and individuals tested to the present date.

We also used [Public Art data from the City of Pittsburgh](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-public-art/resource/00d74e83-8a23-486e-841b-286e1332a151) that describes the different pieces of public art that can be found in the city, along with helpful information about each one.

## Abstract
We were tasked with identifying the "best neighborhood" in the City of Pittsburgh. To accomplish this, we leveraged Covid-19 data and Public Art data as metrics with which to grade neighborhoods.We decided to use Covid-19 data because the Covid-19 pandemic is one of the most prominent issues currently, and any neighborhood that purports to be the best must be handling Covid-19 well. Public art was chosen as a metric because it would be unique and was a way to measure culture in neighborhoods. We combined these different metrics by assigning weights to each one and calculating a score for each neighborhood.

`Covid-19.ipynb` is the notebook analyzing Covid-19 data in various Pittsburgh neighborhoods.
`Public Art.ipynb` is the notebook analyzing Public Art in various Pittsburgh neighborhoods.

`Final Report.ipynb` is the notebook combining these metrics to identify the "best neighborhood" in Pittsburgh. It accomplishes this by assigning a weight to each of the prior metrics, and then calculating a score for each neighborhood. The best neighborhood is the one with the greatest score.

The neighborhood we identified as the best is **WIP**.
